## Navigation {#help-navigation}

Starting from the [Overview](index.html) page, you can browse the
documentation using the links in each page, and in the navigation bar at
the top of each page. The [Index](index-files/index-1.html) and Search
box allow you to navigate to specific declarations and summary pages,
including: [All Packages](allpackages-index.html), [All Classes and
Interfaces](allclasses-index.html)

::: {#search .section .help-section}
### Search

You can search for definitions of modules, packages, types, fields,
methods, system properties and other terms defined in the API. These
items can be searched using part or all of the name, optionally using
\"camelCase\" abbreviations, or multiple search terms separated by
whitespace. Some examples:

-   `"j.l.obj"` matches \"java.lang.Object\"
-   `"InpStr"` matches \"java.io.InputStream\"
-   `"math exact long"` matches \"java.lang.Math.absExact(long)\"

Refer to the [Javadoc Search
Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/specs/javadoc/javadoc-search-spec.html)
for a full description of search features.

## Kinds of Pages {#help-pages}

The following sections describe the different kinds of pages in this
collection.

::: {#overview .section .help-section}
### Overview

The [Overview](index.html) page is the front page of this API document
and provides a list of all packages with a summary for each. This page
can also contain an overall description of the set of packages.
:::

::: {#package .section .help-section}
### Package

Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and
interfaces, with a summary for each. These pages may contain the
following categories:

-   Interfaces
-   Classes
-   Enum Classes
-   Exception Classes
-   Annotation Interfaces
:::

::: {#class .section .help-section}
### Class or Interface

Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own
separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a
declaration and description, member summary tables, and detailed member
descriptions. Entries in each of these sections are omitted if they are
empty or not applicable.

-   Class Inheritance Diagram
-   Direct Subclasses
-   All Known Subinterfaces
-   All Known Implementing Classes
-   Class or Interface Declaration
-   Class or Interface Description

\

-   Nested Class Summary
-   Enum Constant Summary
-   Field Summary
-   Property Summary
-   Constructor Summary
-   Method Summary
-   Required Element Summary
-   Optional Element Summary

\

-   Enum Constant Details
-   Field Details
-   Property Details
-   Constructor Details
-   Method Details
-   Element Details

[Note:]{.help-note} Annotation interfaces have required and optional
elements, but not methods. Only enum classes have enum constants. The
components of a record class are displayed as part of the declaration of
the record class. Properties are a feature of JavaFX.

The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions
are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the
logical groupings established by the programmer.
:::

::: {#doc-file .section .help-section}
### Other Files

Packages and modules may contain pages with additional information
related to the declarations nearby.
:::

::: {#use .section .help-section}
### Use

Each documented package, class and interface has its own Use page. This
page describes what packages, classes, methods, constructors and fields
use any part of the given class or package. Given a class or interface
A, its Use page includes subclasses of A, fields declared as A, methods
that return A, and methods and constructors with parameters of type A.
You can access this page by first going to the package, class or
interface, then clicking on the USE link in the navigation bar.
:::

::: {#tree .section .help-section}
### Tree (Class Hierarchy)

There is a [Class Hierarchy](overview-tree.html) page for all packages,
plus a hierarchy for each package. Each hierarchy page contains a list
of classes and a list of interfaces. Classes are organized by
inheritance structure starting with `java.lang.Object`. Interfaces do
not inherit from `java.lang.Object`.

-   When viewing the Overview page, clicking on TREE displays the
    hierarchy for all packages.
-   When viewing a particular package, class or interface page, clicking
    on TREE displays the hierarchy for only that package.
:::

::: {#serialized-form .section .help-section}
### Serialized Form

Each serializable or externalizable class has a description of its
serialization fields and methods. This information is of interest to
those who implement rather than use the API. While there is no link in
the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going to any
serialized class and clicking \"Serialized Form\" in the \"See Also\"
section of the class description.
:::

::: {#all-packages .section .help-section}
### All Packages

The [All Packages](allpackages-index.html) page contains an alphabetic
index of all packages contained in the documentation.
:::

::: {#all-classes .section .help-section}
### All Classes and Interfaces

The [All Classes and Interfaces](allclasses-index.html) page contains an
alphabetic index of all classes and interfaces contained in the
documentation, including annotation interfaces, enum classes, and record
classes.
:::

::: {#index .section .help-section}
### Index

The [Index](index-files/index-1.html) contains an alphabetic index of
all classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields in the
documentation, as well as summary pages such as [All
Packages](allpackages-index.html), [All Classes and
Interfaces](allclasses-index.html).
